          HOW I STARTED
        </h2>
        <p>
          I started web development in May 2022 by volunteering at an organization to develop a new website.
          At first, I knew little about creating a website.
          I used a landing page software called Carrd to develop the website.
          It was quite a simple software and creating a web page was not too difficult.

          PROGESSION
        </h2>
        <p>
          I started to look deeper into web development and stumbled upon Webflow.
          I looked into and started learning it through Webflow university.
          After developing a basic skillset,
          I started to develop free websites for individuals in my discord community.
          From then on, I started to dive deeper into the world of website development.         </p>

          Currently, I'm proficient in React.js, Svelte.js, Node.js, and Express.js.
          I'm also quite comfortable working with Typescript and creating designs using Tailwind CSS.
          Lately, I've been diving into the world of Robotics.
          My main goal is to become a Full-Stack Developer with a keen eye for Front-End development.         </p>
