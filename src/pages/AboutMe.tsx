          HOW I STARTED
        </h3>
        <p>
          I started web development in May 2022 by volunteering at an organization to develop a new website.
          At first, I knew little about creating a website.
          I used a landing page software called Carrd to develop the website.
          It was quite a simple software and creating a web page was not too difficult.

        <p>
          I started to look deeper into web development and stumbled upon Webflow.
          I looked into and started learning it through Webflow university.
          After developing a basic skillset,
          I started to develop free websites for individuals in my discord community.
          From then on, I started to dive deeper into the world of website development.         </p>
