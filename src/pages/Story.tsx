            HOW I STARTED
          </h2>
          <p>
            I started web development in May 2022 by volunteering at an organization to develop a new website.
            At first, I knew little about creating a website.
            I used a landing page software called Carrd to develop the website.
            It was quite a simple software and creating a web page was not too difficult.

            PROGESSION
          </h2>
          <p>
            I started to look deeper into web development and stumbled upon Webflow.
            I looked into and started learning it through Webflow university.
            After developing a basic skillset,
            I started to develop free websites for individuals in my discord community.
            From then on, I started to dive deeper into the world of website development.         </p>

            Currently, I'm proficient in React.js, Svelte.js, Node.js, and Express.js.
            I'm also quite comfortable working with Typescript and creating designs using Tailwind CSS.
